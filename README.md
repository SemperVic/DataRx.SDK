##### DataRx.SDK Progress Report
Currently, DataRx.SDK is in an alpha development stage designing and implementing object model prototypes to facilitate reverse engineering existing databases as well as designing improved DataRx data taxonomies with metadata support.

This project is active and is being worked on everyday. I am not yet ready for collaboration but when I am -- I am certainly going to look for. That said, if you would like to know more about what I am doing or would like to perhaps join me. Feel free to reach out to me via email or my website.

##### Early Versioning
This project uses a three point versioning system that easily allows you to determine how far into the stage of development the project is in. 

1. The way this three point versioning system works is as follows. 
   - 1.0.0 is equal to [major].[minor].[build].
   - Major
     - The number 1 means the project is new and in early stages of design and development.
   - Minor
     - A zero (0) means there is little to no source code available for unit testing.
     - The number 1 means source code exists and can be consumed.
     - The number 2 means source code is beta and has at least 50% unit test code coverage and API documentation exists and is published.
     - The number 3 means source code is stable and has over 90% unit test code coverage. 
     - Any minor version changes beyond the number 3 suggests you are working back-log changes for the next major release.
   - Build (beginning number)
     - A zero (0) means there is little to no work to show. What code does exist is in a state that is not yet ready for use and does not warrant forking.
     - The number 1+ means source code exists and can be consumed. What code does exist is in a state that is not yet ready for use and does not warrant forking. The larger the number the more commits that have been made.
     - The number 2+ means source code exists, is well commented and can be consumed. An accompanying Unit testing project is created in this stage where code coverage will push toward 50%.
     - The number 3+ means source code exists with at least 50% code coverage. Before incrementing the minor version, you will need to add an additional API documentation project to the DataRx.SDK VS Solution.

**Current Version:** 1.0.0

What code does exist is in a state that is not yet ready for use and does not warrant forking.
