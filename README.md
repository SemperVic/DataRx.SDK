## DataRx.SDK Progress Report
Currently, DataRx.SDK is in an alpha development stage designing and implementing object model prototypes to facilitate reverse engineering existing databases as well as designing improved Arizona data taxonomies with metadata support.

This project is active and is being worked on everyday. I am not yet ready for collaboration but when I am, I am certainly going to reach out for help.
