# DataRX.SDK GitHub Project Version Log
This project will initially use a three point early versioning convention that easily allows you to determine how far into the stage of development a DataRX project is in.

- Development Stage: Alpha
- Current Version: 1.0.1

## Commit Milestones & Notes:
- Mar 2018 (Alpha)
  - Establishing project guidelines and documentation
  - Added Unit Testing Project (DataRx.SDK.Test)

- Feb 2018 (Alpha)
  - Established DataRx.SDK namespace
  - Added Common SDK class model for utilitarian processes
  - Added Composite Entity/Attribute Object Model

## How it works:

All versioning uses a three point number system between 0 and 3 separated by the dot '.' character as in Version 3.2.1. Structurally, 1.0.0 equals [Major].[Minor].[Build].

*Stages of Early Development Phases*
- [0] Planning & Design Phase
- [1] Alpha Development Phase
- [2] Beta Development Phase
- [3] Stable Release

*Early Version Meaning*

The value of 0 (zero) means there is little to no work to show depending on the stage of development. Depending on the index position of the zero determines how well the project is progressing toward maturity and eventually code completion.

The number 1 means the project is new and in early stages of design and development. This is particularly true with major and minor stages of development.

The number 2 means source code is in beta phase depending on the stage of development

The number 3 means source code is stable for the stage of development the project is in.

*Accordingly, the following illustrates the level of maturity a DataRx project is measured by.*

- Versions 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 is in a planning stage.
- Versions 1.0.2xx to 1.1.3xx is in an alpha stage of development
- Versions 1.1.3xx to 1.2.3xx is in a beta stage of development
- Versions 1.2.3xx to 1.3.xxx is considered a release candidate
- Versions 1.3.xxx to 1.3.3 is considered a stable release
- Versions 1.3.4 is considered stable code in maintence mode only
- Versions 2.0.0 and above means the code has matured in Arizona's container.
